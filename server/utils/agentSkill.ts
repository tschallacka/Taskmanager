# Taskmanager

Taskmanager is a project and task manager: boards of tasks in columns, with
dates, assignees, custom fields, status updates, messages, time tracking and an
inbox. This skill lets you read and change it for the person whose API key you
were given.

## Connecting

The server speaks MCP over HTTP at \`${origin.replace(/\/$/, '')}/api/mcp\` and
expects \`Authorization: Bearer <api key>\`. The person creates the key under
Settings, chooses its permissions and can revoke it at any time:

- \`boards:read\` lets you read.
- \`boards:write\` lets you change things.
- \`secrets:read\` lets you list a project's secrets and get its .env text.
- \`secrets:write\` lets you add, change and delete a project's secrets (managers only).

A key belongs to one workspace (their personal one, or one team). Never print the
key, put it in a file you commit, or paste it into a task or message.

## You act as the person, and no more

A key is the person acting through you. You can open the same boards they can
and you see the same things they see on them. Anything hidden from them is hidden
from you, and anything the app would refuse them is refused to you.

- **On their team's boards** you see every task, update and custom field.
- **On a customer's board, as a customer's contact**, you see only tasks and
  updates that are shared with customers, no custom fields, and none of the
  team's status updates, messages or time. You can file a task. You cannot plan
  it (dates, assignee, done mark, fields), change it, or change the board.
- Trashed things are not there. Deleting puts things in the board's trash, which
  the person can restore; nothing here deletes for good (the one exception is an update removed with delete_task_update, which is gone at once), and boards cannot be
  deleted over MCP.

When a tool refuses with a reason that names a customer role, that is the rule
working, not a fault: tell the person what you could not do and why, and do not
look for another route to it.

## How to work

1. **Read before you write.** \`get_board\` gives the board, column and task names
   exactly as written; use them verbatim. \`get_task\` has the full description
   and the thread of updates, oldest first. On a long one, read a slice first (see "Reading a long thread").
2. **Say what you will change, then change only that.** Writes replace the value
   you send, so for a description read the task first and send the whole text.
3. **Clearing:** pass an empty string to clear a date or assignee, and \`null\` to
   clear a custom field value.
4. **Dates** are \`YYYY-MM-DD\`. **Durations** are written like \`1h 30m\`, \`1:30\`
   or \`45m\`; a bare number is hours.
5. **Be brief in what you post.** Updates, messages and status updates are read
   by people; say what changed and why in a few sentences.
6. **Check your result.** Write tools return the card or entry as it is stored;
   read it rather than assuming.

## Reading a long thread

A plain \`get_task\` (\`{"id": "<task id>"}\`) gives the 5 newest updates, newest first, so a long thread does not fill your context. Keep what you read: do not read a task again while you still have it, only when what you have may be out of date.

To catch up on a task you read before, pass \`since\` with the id of the newest update you have: \`{"id": "<task id>", "since": "<update id>"}\`. That gives every update after it, oldest first, none skipped, so you read them in the order they were written. Keep the id of the newest one for the next time.

When you need more of the thread, because the 5 newest leave out what you need or you are looking for something, these options help:

- \`limit\`: \`{"id": "<task id>", "limit": 50}\` gives the fifty newest; with \`"order": "oldest"\` the fifty oldest, which is how you read a thread from its start.
- \`order\`: \`"oldest"\` or \`"newest"\`. Left out, a plain read is newest first and a read with \`since\` or \`prefix\` oldest first.
- \`since\`: an update id, or a full ISO 8601 time with a zone, such as \`{"id": "<task id>", "since": "2026-11-02T10:00:00Z"}\`. Gives every update strictly after it.
- \`prefix\`: \`{"id": "<task id>", "prefix": "NITPICKER:"}\` gives every update whose body starts with that text, ignoring case, oldest first.

Filters apply before the limit, so \`{"id": "<task id>", "prefix": "QUESTION", "order": "newest", "limit": 1}\` is the latest question. The result says \`updatesMatched\` (how many matched in all) and \`updatesShown\` (how many came back). When they differ you have a slice, not the whole thread. Counts cover only the updates you may see. There is no paging: to read on, pass \`since\` with the id of the last update you have, which is the cursor to prefer. \`since\` is strictly after, so an update made in the same millisecond as the mark is left out. A thread over 5000 updates is cut, and the result says so in \`threadNote\`: use \`since\`.

## Tools

${sections.join('\n\n')}

Each tool's full description and parameters are in the server's \`tools/list\`
answer; trust that over this summary if they differ.
