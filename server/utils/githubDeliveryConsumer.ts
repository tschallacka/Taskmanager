// The consumer of GitHub deliveries. It takes one queued delivery at a time, applies it through
// processGithubDelivery, and returns what should happen to it: ack (applied, or applied before), a retry on a
// delay queue, or the failed path. On the failed path the database row is written first, then the queue
// copies the delivery to `failed`, then the original is acked. Every failure the adapter decides itself (a
// timeout, a throw, an oversize body) goes through beforeFail first, so it has its row too.
//
// Budgets. One delivery's whole run (its database calls and its work) has BUDGET_MS. The queue gives the handler
// ADAPTER_TIMEOUT_MS, which must be longer, so the consumer always answers first. Each database call of a run has
// DB_LIMIT_MS and never outlives the budget. The failure record and the late answers use their own DB_LIMIT_MS,
// so a run that ran out of budget still records its last failure.
//
// Abort. When the adapter gives up on an attempt, its signal is aborted; so is the apply's signal when the budget
// runs out. The run stops at its next step. The apply stops at its next store call: processGithubDelivery checks
// its signal before each card-store call and leaves a call that is waiting behind (see guardStore in githubCards).
// A store write that is already running may still finish on its own; no later call runs. Card writes are
// idempotent, so such a write is harmless when the delivery is retried.
//
// Late answers. An apply that finishes after its attempt was given up is decided by the attempt number, and the
// retry copy or the failed row already published decides what it may change:
//   - attempts made before the last one: a late success or failure is discarded. The retry copy is in the delay
//     queue and runs the work again (idempotent), so it is the one that records the success.
//   - the last attempt: the failed row was already written. A late success is recorded (success row) and the row
//     goes to resolved; a late failure is discarded (the row stays as it is).
// A late answer writes no hold and no new row of its own; each one logs one line with the delivery id.
//
// Ordering. One consumer with prefetch 1 applies one delivery at a time. A retry leaves main, so while a delivery
// of a repository waits in a delay queue its later deliveries would overtake it. They are not applied: they are
// published behind it in the same delay queue (same wait, so they come back after it) and acked here. The hold
// lasts at most HOLD_MAX_AGE_MS. It lives in this process: a restart forgets it, so a delivery that arrives after
// the restart can be applied before an older retried one, and the older one can then overwrite the newer content.
// An abandoned attempt sets no hold either (the retry copy is published by the adapter), so the same window applies.
// Idempotence prevents duplicates, not that order. Two consumers would not share the hold.
//
// Busy. An apply of a repository that is still running (an orphan of an abandoned attempt) is not overlapped. The
// delivery waits in the 30 s queue with the same attempt count, up to MAX_BUSY_DEFERRALS times in a row; then it
// takes an attempt. Once the orphan is older than the hold age, the next busy delivery takes an attempt too. So a
// hung orphan costs its repository at most the ladder, never an unbounded wait.
//
// At-least-once. A crash between a side effect and the ack, or between a publish and the ack, makes the broker
// redeliver. The card writes check what exists first, and the success row in github_deliveries makes a redelivery
// of an applied delivery a plain ack. A crash between a retry publish and the ack leaves a second copy of the retry;
// a crash between the copy to `failed` and the ack leaves a second copy there. Both are known.
