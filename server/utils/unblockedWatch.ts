// The "unblocked" news (GH #36, slice 5): when the last open blocker of a task finishes, the task's
// assignee gets an Inbox note and an agent event, and the crew's pm gets the agent event. Nothing moves
// by itself. Blocked-ness is derived (taskDependencyService), so a dependent is told only when it was
// blocked before this change and is not blocked now: the blocker is the one that just finished.
// Called once per real change: from notifyTaskChange (moves, completion) and from the two trash paths and the bulk column paths (tellUnblockedAfterBulk).
// A column delete that moves its tasks into a neighbour finishes them when that neighbour is a finishing column, so their dependents are told.
// Pure parts first (tested on their own); the database part reads the board and sends.
// The Inbox notes wait for a short window to close so a burst becomes one note: the windows live in this process,
// so a note whose window is still open when the server stops is not sent (the agent events are in memory too and are not replayed).
