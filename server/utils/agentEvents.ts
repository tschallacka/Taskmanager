//                       person|agent|github|rule on task_created, github on the GitHub kinds, null otherwise;
//                       title is cut to 120 characters with control characters removed; the two
//                       *_me fields are booleans (assigned_to_me: the card's assignee is this
//                       user when the event was made); ref is the pull request number and the branch on the
//                       GitHub kinds, cut to 60 characters, else null; is_pm and is_boss are booleans,
//                       true when this user is the crew's pm or boss key (on the GitHub kinds, else false)
